Hello world!
  I started my coding journey February 2 2022. It was just another day like no other except, I kept remembering a suggestion that a friend had made. It was lingering in my head for a while how he kept going on about people making great pay for doing things no different than customizing a myspace page. As you would guess, I was sold. Myspace had been around for only a short while when I was a freshman in high school. At the time, I was a lonely kid with few friends, and myspace was soon taking over consensus mainstream social network. The site gave each user the ability to create a unique page that was generated by code. After copying and pasting enough code, I soon found myself adjusting elements within the code provided.

I soon realized…. It was a bit more than designing a myspace page.
